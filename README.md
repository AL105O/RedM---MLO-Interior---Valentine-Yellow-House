This custom MLO is a fully furnished residential-style interior designed for use in RedM. The space is built around a single interior shell and filled with a curated collection of high-detail props to create a warm, lived-in living environment.
The interior uses a Victorian / late-1800s parlor aesthetic, with careful object placement to match the era of Red Dead Redemption 2. The environment includes multiple themed zones, decorative elements, seating, storage, and personal belongings to give the location character and narrative depth.

Design Intent
The interior is created as a multi-purpose residential space that can represent:
A personal home in Valentine
An NPC’s living quarters
A boarding house room
A side-room for roleplay use (lore-friendly and fully decorated)
The goal was to deliver a fully dressed, lore-accurate interior without relying on empty or generic spaces. Each region of the MLO is arranged to look like someone genuinely lives there, with scattered letters, furniture, decorative paintings, and personal effects.

Entity Count
This MLO contains ~150 placed entities, covering:
Furniture
Decorations
Lighting
Clothing props
Paintings and wall art
Surface detail props
All objects use standard Rockstar assets and should be performance-friendly.
